"""
Shared-memory budget for the Triton attention kernels.

The tile configs in this package are sized for the ~100 KB of dynamic shared memory that Ampere
and later grant a block. Older parts grant less (Turing: 64 KB), and Triton does not shrink a
tile on its own: a kernel whose compiled footprint exceeds the limit fails at launch with
OutOfResources. Guessing per-architecture tiles is unreliable because the footprint of the same
config differs between architectures (no cp.async pipelining below sm_80, for one), so each
launch site lists a ladder of configs instead -- the stock config first, then progressively
smaller tiles -- and pick_config() walks it with compile-only warmups, taking the first whose
measured footprint fits the device. Picks are cached per launch key, so the walk is paid once
per kernel family, and on a full-budget device the first candidate always fits, which is exactly
the compile the launch would have done anyway.
