"""
Row-addressable table behind an embedding module (token embeddings, hashed n-gram embeddings),
held in system RAM or streamed from disk. Streaming is a first-class mode: the table's tensors
are never loaded, the table keeps DiskTensorHandles from the loader and gathers only the rows a
forward pass actually touches.

Lookups run on the CPU, where the token ids already live (pinned in the generator, so nothing
round-trips through the device): the owning module resolves ids to unique table rows, the rows
are gathered with threaded preads (disk) or index_select (RAM) into a pinned staging set, and
one non-blocking H2D feeds the module's decode and the inverse gather.

The staging step depends only on the token ids, so it can run ahead of the forward on a worker
thread (prefetch()). Each queued prefetch owns one staging set; lookup() takes the set whose
staged ids equal the ones it was given and stages inline otherwise, so a prefetch for the wrong
ids can only cost time. A set's CUDA event marks the last lookup's uploads from it; the next
writer waits on it before reusing the buffers.
