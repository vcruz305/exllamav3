"""
Host-side CPU placement for the CPU MoE offload path.

The worker pool (cpu/moe_mul1.cpp Pool) pins one compute thread per physical core, in
physical_core_order(): one LP per core first, then every SMT sibling. The parent process (the
thread driving the forward pass, CUDA's driver threads, an API server's executor threads) is
not pinned, so the scheduler can drop it on a worker's LP. A pinned worker cannot move away,
so it becomes the straggler at every per-phase barrier of the job. This module plans and applies
that placement.
