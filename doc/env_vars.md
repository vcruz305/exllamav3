# Environment variables

Runtime and build-time toggles recognized by ExLlamaV3. All of these have sensible defaults;
they exist mainly for A/B testing, debugging and working around platform quirks.

Boolean-ish variables treat `0` as off and any other value as on unless noted. C++-side
variables are read once (on first use) and cached; Python-side variables are read at import
time. Either way, set them before loading a model.

## Attention

### `EXL3_BC_ATTN` (default: `1`)

Graph-captured C++ decode attention. For decode steps (bsz ≤ 8, q_len ≤ 16) the whole attention
block -- q/k/v projections, fused head norm + RoPE, cache append, flash-decoding attention and
o_proj -- runs as a single C++ call, captured as one CUDA graph per (bsz, q_len) shape and
replayed with only the input/output/position/block-table pointers patched. Removes effectively
all Python host time from the attention block; the largest gains are on host-bound setups
(small or hybrid models, fast GPUs, contended CPUs). The same flag covers the equivalent path
for MLA layers (BC_MLAttention: q projections, latent projection and staging, partial RoPE,
W_UK absorption, cache append, absorbed flash-decoding, W_UV unfold and o_proj as one graph).

Module or cache configurations the path does not support (TP, headwise gates, LayerNorm or
span-heads head norms, non-EXL3 projections, compander-enabled quant cache, ...) fall back to
the regular dispatch path by design. Unexpected errors while building the path are raised, not
swallowed. Set to `0` to disable the path entirely.

### `EXL3_BC_ATTN_TRACE` (default: `0`)

Print one line per attention module/cache-layer pair when the graph-captured decode path is
built or declined (module key, device). Activation check for A/B tests: a benchmark comparing
`EXL3_BC_ATTN` settings is only meaningful if the enabled run actually built the path.

### `EXL3_BC_DSA` (default: `1`)

DeepSeek-V4 counterpart of `EXL3_BC_ATTN`: for decode steps (bsz 1, q_len ≤ 16) the whole DSA
attention step runs as one graph-captured C++ call: the batched x-side projection fan, fused
head-norm RoPE, both compressor updates (compressed/indexer entry pools and rings), the
lightning-indexer scoring and capture-safe top-k selection (long-context regime), the
flash-decoding sparse attention with fused output de-rotation, the grouped o_proj and the
sliding-window ring append. One graph per (cache layer, job slot, q_len, dense/top-k regime);
position flows through shared device scalars (one 8-byte host write per step per job) plus a
handful of patched scalar node parameters (live pool width, causal bounds), so replays never
rebuild anything. Steps that need a host-side window ring shift or rebase (page-granular, rare)
decline to the eager path for that step, as do ineligible layer configurations (non-EXL3
projections, ...) permanently. Set to `0` to force the eager path everywhere.

### `EXL3_BC_MLA` (default: `1`)

MLA counterpart of `EXL3_BC_ATTN`: decode steps (q_len ≤ 16) of an MLA layer run as one
graph-captured C++ block (projections, absorb, latent attention, unfold, o_proj). Set to `0` to
force the eager dispatch path, for A/B testing.

### `EXL3_MOE_SHARED_COOP` (default: `1`)

MoE layers with a shared expert run it, at decode batch sizes, as a one-expert launch of the fused
expert kernels (at the shared expert's own bit width) instead of the three separate GEMV launches
of its own graph; the routed launch merges the result as before. Applies to EXL3-quantized gated
shared experts with 128-aligned widths and no post-norm. Under tensor parallelism such a shared
expert is placed whole on one rank (its contribution enters the all-reduce from that rank only)
rather than split across ranks. Set to `0` to keep the separate graph and the tensor split.

### `EXL3_GR_MIX_TILED` (default: `1`)

Prefill-sized mixes of the Qwen3.8-style gated residual (`GatedResidual`, the low-rank
hyper-connection) run a tiled CUDA kernel whose GEMMs use exact int8 tensor-core accumulation with
a fixed fp32 combination, so the result is bit-identical on every GPU architecture and
tensor-parallel ranks compute identical streams (a prerequisite for replicating decisions such as
MoE routing across ranks instead of broadcasting them). Precision matches the fp16 path and it is
faster than the cuBLAS path it replaces. Set to `0` to fall back to the cuBLAS GEMM path
(device-dependent kernel choice, not rank-consistent). Decode-sized mixes use the fused `gr_mix`
kernel either way. The same int8 scheme covers the MoE router projection for batched rows
(`routing_gemm.cu`), which has no switch.

### `EXL3_BC_GDN` (default: `1`)

Gated-delta-net (Qwen3-Next/3.5, KDA in GLM-5.3/Kimi Linear) counterpart of `EXL3_BC_ATTN`:
the decode step of a linear-attention layer runs as one graph-captured C++ call. Set to `0` to
force the torch path, for A/B testing.

### `EXL3_BC_DSA_DEBUG` (default: `0`)

Raise errors encountered while building the graphed DSA path instead of silently declining to
the eager path. Diagnostic for why a configuration falls back.

### `EXL3_DSV4_NO_XFAN` (default: `0`)

Set to disable the eager DSA path's projection fans. With the fans, the x-side projections that
share the block input (q_a, wkv, and the compressor/indexer kv/gate pairs) run as a single
per-matrix-N batched MGEMM, and q_b pairs with the indexer query projection over q_res the same
way in the top-k regime: six to eight GEMV launches collapse into two. A/B switch for the
eager path only; the graphed path (`EXL3_BC_DSA`) builds its own fan and is not affected.
Layers whose projections mix quantization formats or bitrates decline the fan by themselves.

### `EXL3_QC_STAGING` (default: `1`)

How quantized K/V caches feed the attention kernels (replaces the former `EXL3_QC_ATTN`). Only
affects quantized caches.

- `0` - no staging: packed cache tensors feed the prefill and decode kernels directly, with
  dequantization fused into the kernel loads. Lowest memory: no staging scratch is ever
  allocated, and nothing extra is reserved during autosplit loading. Prefill pays for the
  in-kernel expansion (roughly 5–25% on the attention kernel depending on bitrate and GPU),
  which every kv tile repeats once per query block and sibling query head.
- `1` - prefill staging (default): prefill chunks of 256+ tokens dequantize the referenced
  cache window once into a shared fp16 scratch and run the fp16 kernel over it, putting
  quantized-cache prefill within ~1–3% of fp16. Decode stays on the direct path. The scratch is
  sized for the full cache at batch size 1 (`2 * max_num_tokens * num_kv_heads * head_dim`
  fp16 elements, shared across layers per device) and is allocated by the autosplit measuring
  pass, so the space is reserved at load time rather than discovered at the first long prefill.
  For very large caches this reservation is the tradeoff to weigh against `0` (e.g. ~4 GB at
  1M tokens with 8 kv heads of dim 128).
- `2` - full staging: legacy dequantize-then-attend path; whole cache layers are expanded into
  full-size fp16 temporaries before attention. Debug/A-B mode (same effect as the former
  `EXL3_QC_ATTN=0`); only affects decode if `EXL3_BC_ATTN` is also disabled, since the graphed
  decode path reads the packed cache directly.

### `EXL3_QC_PF_TWO_PASS_MIN_Q` (default: `256`)

Query-length threshold for the prefill staging pass at `EXL3_QC_STAGING=1`. Chunks shorter than
this keep the direct path, which reads less global memory (relevant for short trailing chunks
over long contexts at low cache bitrates). Tuning/testing knob.

### `EXL3_QC_PREFILL_NS` (default: `0` = measure)

Pipeline stage count for the direct quantized-cache prefill kernel. Unset/`0`, the best of
{1, 2} is measured once per (shape family, device) at first use; a nonzero value pins it,
skipping the measurement. Only relevant where the direct path still runs (`EXL3_QC_STAGING=0`,
or short chunks below the threshold above).

### `EXL3_MLA_PREFILL` (default: `mha`)

Prefill strategy for MLA layers: `mha` up-projects past latent tiles from the compressed cache
and attends in MHA form (~2.8× fewer FLOPs per query-past pair); `absorbed` restores the
single-kernel absorbed-form prefill for A/B testing.

### `EXL3_PREFER_FA2` (default: `0`)

Put the flash-attn-2 backends ahead of the built-in Triton attention kernels in the dispatch
order. flash-attn is an optional dependency; when it is not installed, this switch is ignored
(with a warning) and the built-in kernels serve everything. The Triton kernels match or beat
FA2 across supported hardware and cover more cases (quantized caches, head dims > 256,
attention sinks); this switch exists for A/B comparison.

## EXL3 GEMM / GEMV

### `EXL3_GEMV` (default: `1`)

QTIP-style small-m fp16 GEMV path, dispatched from the main GEMM entry point when the shape
heuristic applies. `0` disables, `1` uses the measured heuristic envelope (default), `2` forces
the path wherever its hard constraints allow (testing).

### `EXL3_GEMV_SMEM` (default: `-1`)

Weight-extraction strategy inside the fp16 GEMV kernel: `-1` picks per bitrate (default), `0`
forces shuffle extraction, `1` forces shared-memory staging. Testing only.

### `EXL3_INT8_GEMV` (default: `2`)

Fused int8-activation GEMV for tensors quantized with the mul1 codebook: one cooperative launch
covering the input Hadamard, activation quantization, dp4a GEMV and output Hadamard. `2`
(default) is the plain int8 mode, `1` the error-feedback residual mode (~15–16 bit effective
activation precision, slightly slower), `0` disables the path.

Tensors quantized with other codebooks are unaffected and keep their regular kernels. When the
mode is enabled, gate/up (and other same-input) tensor pairs that the int8 path can take are
also *unfused* from the batched MGEMM when each matrix is wide enough to fill the GPU on its
own. See the two thresholds below. The graphed decode paths (BC modules) handle both the fused
and unfused configurations.

### `EXL3_INT8_GEMV_MAX_K` (default: per-arch)

Highest bitrate K the int8 GEMV path accepts; above it the regular fp16 kernel runs instead.
The default is 6 on Hopper and Blackwell and 5 elsewhere: Ampere is DRAM-bound from K = 6 up,
where the int8 path's reduced per-weight compute no longer helps (and Ada is marginal there),
but on Hopper the fp16 kernel is throughput-bound at K = 6 as well. Values up to 8 can be forced
to test the crossover on unmeasured parts; the MGEMM unfusing threshold below follows this cap
automatically.

### `EXL3_MGEMM_K_THRESHOLD` (default: per-arch), `EXL3_MGEMM_N_THRESHOLD` (default: `8192`)

Unfusing heuristics applied when the int8 GEMV mode is enabled, to mul1 tensor pairs only: keep
the fused MGEMM when the bitrate K is at or above the K threshold (the int8 path declines those
anyway), or when the matrices are narrower than the N threshold (too narrow for separate GEMV
calls to fill the GPU; batching is what restores utilization there). The K threshold defaults
to one above the int8 path's per-arch K cap (see `EXL3_INT8_GEMV_MAX_K`); setting it explicitly
pins it on every device.

### `EXL3_NO_FUSED_RECONSTRUCT` (default: `0`)

Set to disable original-basis weight reconstruction on the hgemm prefill path. Long inputs to
EXL3 linears run reconstruct-then-GEMM; by default the reconstruct kernel emits the weights in
the original basis. Both 128-point Hadamard transforms and the sign vectors are folded into
the (memory-bound) reconstruct kernel's shared-memory epilogue, so the GEMM runs on the raw
input and the standalone input/output Hadamard launches disappear (previously ~14% of
long-chunk prefill GPU time; ~+6-7% prefill throughput on DeepSeek-V4-Flash). The fused kernel
does k·n-proportional extra work while the saved Hadamard traffic scales with rows·(k+n), so it
engages at 1024+ input rows (breakeven is ~400–900 depending on shape); below that, and for the
per-expert MoE dequant path (small row counts per expert), the rotated-basis pipeline
(input Hadamard → GEMM → output Hadamard) is kept. Set to `1` to force the rotated-basis
pipeline everywhere, for A/B testing.

### `EXLLAMAV3_TUNE_CACHE` (default: platform cache dir)

Override the path of the on-disk autotune cache for the cooperative GEMM kernels (kernel shape
selection results, persisted across runs).

## Sampling

### `EXL3_FUSED_SAMPLER` (default: `1`)

Collapse eligible sampler stacks into fused kernels at sampler construction. Stacks ending in
greedy or temperature/min-P/top-K/top-P/Gumbel steps (in the orders emitted by the preset
samplers, optionally preceded by repetition/presence/frequency penalties) run as a few custom
kernels working directly in logit space, instead of the step-by-step softmax/sort pipeline.
Collapsed temperature/min-P stacks sample the same token as the uncollapsed reference for the
same seed, up to float rounding at exact ties; top-K/top-P stacks keep the same token set as
the sort-based reference (ties at the exact cutoff are all kept) but draw their Gumbel noise by
token id rather than sorted position, so individual seeds map to different samples from the
same distribution. Stacks the collapse does not recognize fall back to the step-by-step path by
design. Set to `0` to disable collapsing entirely, e.g. for A/B validation against the
reference implementation.

## CPU MoE offload

Experimental: `-mcl`/`--moe_cpu_offload` (main model) and `-dmcl`/`--draft_moe_cpu_layers`
(draft model or MTP head) run the routed experts of the first N block-sparse MoE layers on the
CPU, expert weights resident in system RAM, freeing the VRAM those layers' experts would have
used. Layer-split mode only; requires mul1-codebook experts, K ≤ 8, and uniform per-expert
biases (all or none; ineligible layers fall back to the GPU as usual). A spawned worker process
per model component (main / draft / MTP) owns its own expert weights and a job ring in pinned
shared memory; the parent's forward pass never blocks on the CPU. During prefill, hot experts
additionally stream their weights to the GPU and run there (via the fused kernel or per-expert
dequant, by size) while the CPU works the remaining tail. See `-mclt`/`-dmclt` below for 
thread configuration, and the knobs below for tuning the split.

These knobs are collected in `exllamav3/model/moe_cpu_host.py`'s `MoeCpuTuning` class (read once
from the environment at import); for a same-process sweep, mutate fields on the module-level
`TUNING` singleton before constructing a model instead of setting env vars.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_OFFLOAD` (default: `0`)

Fallback value for when `-mcl` is not set.

### `-mclt` / `--moe_cpu_threads`, `-dmclt` / `--draft_moe_cpu_threads` (CLI, not env)

Worker thread count, set per component via `config.infer_params.moe_cpu_threads` /
`draft_moe_cpu_threads`. Takes precedence over `EXL3_MOE_CPU_THREADS` below when set.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_THREADS` (default: `cpu_count // 2`)

Fallback worker thread count when the component's `-mclt`/`-dmclt` config value is not set.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_SLOTS` (default: `4`), `EXL3_MOE_CPU_SLOT_ROWS` (default: `64`)

Compute job-ring depth and rows per slot (the CPU-tail chunk size). Each slot holds one
in-flight chunk of the D2H-staged input, selected experts and routing weights, and the
H2D-staged fp32 output.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_WSLOTS` (default: `2`), `EXL3_MOE_CPU_WSLOT_MB` (default: `32`)

Depth and per-slot size of the pinned/VRAM weight-staging ring used by GPU-streamed prefill.
Each slot must be large enough to hold a batch of streamed experts' packed weights (see
`EXL3_MOE_STREAM_BATCH_EXPERTS`); if not, the batch is capped by capacity instead.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_STAGE_THREADS` (default: `4`)

Memcpy threads used by the worker's dedicated stager (which packs streamed experts' weights
into the pinned staging ring, concurrently with the compute pool working the CPU tail). A few
threads saturate host memcpy bandwidth; raising this mainly helps wide streamed batches on
models with many small experts (see issue trace on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B).

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_T` (default: per-device, bandwidth-scaled from `16`)

Minimum per-expert token-assignment count (in a prefill chunk) for an expert's weights to be
streamed to the GPU instead of computed on the CPU tail. Unset, the effective threshold scales
inversely with the measured pinned→device bandwidth (probed once per device): a chipset-attached
x4 link needs a much hotter expert to justify the weight DMA than a CPU-direct x16 one. On
Windows the driver drops an idle link to Gen1, so the probe keeps traffic on it for at least
0.5 s and until the rate is steady. Setting this explicitly pins the threshold on every device
and disables the bandwidth scaling.

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_FUSED_T` (default: `256`)

Maximum per-expert assignment count eligible for the fused `exl3_moe` GPU kernel (one launch
covers a whole batch of experts, up to three with the row tiles of `EXL3_MOE_MTILE`); above
this an expert still streams but runs through the batched reconstruct tier
(`EXL3_MOE_STREAM_BATCH_RECON`) or the per-expert reconstruct path instead. Same eligibility as
the GPU-resident fused path otherwise (mul1, silu/gelu gated or relu2 gateless, no per-expert
biases, no padded dims); ineligible layers use the reconstruct path for every streamed expert
regardless of count. The default was 512 while the alternative above it was the per-expert
loop; with the batched tier there, 128-256 measure best (Qwen3.8 4090 + 3090 split, 4k
chunks: 512 -> 256 +4%; mistral-small-4 119B full offload on the PRO 6000: +2.8%), and the
fused temp buffers (concurrency x T x (2 hidden + 2 intermediate) x 2 bytes per device) halve.

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_MIN_ROWS` (default: `32`)

Prefill chunk size floor below which GPU streaming never engages and every expert runs on the
CPU tail as usual (decode, at 1 row per pass, always stays under this).

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_BATCH_EXPERTS` (default: `24`, max `256`)

Experts packed per weight-staging batch (one stage job, one DMA, and, below
`EXL3_MOE_STREAM_FUSED_T, one fused-kernel launch). Further capped by staging-slot capacity
(`EXL3_MOE_CPU_WSLOT_MB` divided by one expert's packed byte size). The hard ceiling of 256 is
the structural size of the job descriptor's expert-id array; raising the ceiling itself costs
only a small amount of shared-memory overprovisioning, not runtime.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_MAX_ISA` (default: unset, auto-detect)

Caps the CPU kernel's runtime ISA detection at `scalar`, `avx2`, `bw`/`avx512bw`,
`vnni`/`avx512`, or `vbmi`, for testing a lower-tier kernel path on hardware that supports
better. The `bw` tier covers AVX-512F/BW/VL hardware without VNNI (Skylake-SP/X: 1st-gen Xeon
Scalable, Core-X), which previously fell through to `avx2`: the `vnni` dword kernel with the
AVX2 tier's vpmaddubsw/vpmaddwd accumulate, ~1.5x the `avx2` tier's cold-expert decode
throughput on a Xeon Gold 6148. The `vbmi` tier
(AVX512-VBMI byte-gather state extraction, Zen 4+ / Ice Lake+; Cascade/Cooper Lake have VNNI
without VBMI and stay on the `vnni` tier) is 15-70% faster than the dword scheme depending on
bitrate. Never upgrades past what the CPU actually supports; unrecognized values are ignored.
Read once per process (parent and worker independently), so it must be set before either is
started. Note that capping below `bw` also disables the swizzled weight layout (see
`EXL3_MOE_CPU_SWIZZLE`).

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_SWIZZLE` (default: `1`)

Repack the CPU worker's expert trellis copies into a band-contiguous ("swizzled") layout at
load, so each GEMV band streams sequentially from DRAM instead of in short strided runs
(+45-75% cold decode GEMV throughput measured on a 7960X, reaching the sequential-read
roofline). Takes effect on every AVX-512 kernel tier: `vbmi`, whose byte-gather extraction
leaves the register headroom for the wide bands the swizzled layout wants at m > 1, `bw`
(+2-29% on Skylake-SP, where the sequential per-band k-stream beats 96-128 B strided reads)
and `vnni` (the dword kernel with the same band structure; +40% cold-expert decode measured
with the tier forced on a 7960X). The `avx2` and `scalar` tiers read the native layout. K8
tensors always stay in the native layout (they route to the dword kernel). The GPU-streaming
prefill path un-swizzles during staging, so staged bytes reaching the GPU dequant are
unaffected. Set to `0` to keep the native layout.

### `EXL3_MOE_MEMOPS` (default: `1`)

The parent enqueues its wait/publish handshake with the worker as CUDA stream memory operations
(`cuStreamWaitValue32`/`WriteValue32`, front-end executed: no SM occupancy, no per-op launch
cost) rather than the older spin-wait kernels. Set to `0` to force the kernel fallback, kept
around specifically because the memop path is not yet exercised on Windows. The kernel path's
30-second stall timeout does not apply to the memop path; a dead worker there is instead detected
by a host-side watchdog that unblocks any pending wait.

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_DEBUG` (default: `0`)

Print per-layer and per-batch engagement: streamed bandwidth probe result and threshold, expert
counts, streamed-vs-tail assignment split, and fused-vs-reconstruct tier split within each
streamed batch.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_PROF` (default: `0`)

Accumulate per-phase wall time in the CPU compute pool and report every 512 jobs. Enabled once
per worker at startup.

### `EXL3_MOE_ARENA_DEBUG` (default: `0`)

Print each hugepage-arena chunk allocation (size, running total) as the CPU worker loads expert
weights, and confirmation when the end-of-load `MADV_COLLAPSE` pass (see
`EXL3_MOE_ARENA_HUGEPAGE`) is issued. The worker copies loaded expert tensors into a small
number of large (1 GiB) anonymous mappings instead of leaving them as many separate small
(sub-2MB) allocations, confirmed via `/proc/<pid>/smaps` that the latter cannot be backed by
transparent huge pages even under system-wide THP=always, since each is its own VMA.

### `EXL3_MOE_ARENA_HUGEPAGE` (default: `1`)

Whether to attempt hugepage promotion for the arena chunks described above. This is done as a
single `MADV_COLLAPSE` (Linux 6.1+) pass over each chunk *after* all expert weights for every
offloaded layer have been loaded, deliberately not via a live `MADV_HUGEPAGE` hint during the
per-layer writes: on hosts where `/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag` is `madvise`, that
hint makes the kernel do *synchronous* compaction on first touch of a hinted region once
easily-compactable free memory runs low, which turns into multi-second stalls per offloaded
layer partway through a large model's load. The collapse pass runs on a background thread in
the worker after it has started serving: it copies the whole arena (about 4 GiB/s on a
7960X when the chunks were faulted as 4K pages, i.e. on `transparent_hugepage/enabled =
madvise` hosts, plus any compaction the kernel needs first), so it must not sit on the
startup path; the worker reads 4K pages until each chunk lands. `EXL3_MOE_ARENA_DEBUG=1`
prints how long it took. Set to `0` to skip hugepage promotion entirely.

### `EXL3_HGEMM_F16ACC` (default: auto)

GeForce parts run the fp32-accumulator tensor-core MMA at half the rate of the fp16-accumulator
form (measured 2.00x on the 3090, 4090 and 5090; 1.00x on the RTX PRO 6000). The reconstruct
(prefill) GEMMs, i.e. the dense `Linear` path above the reconstruct threshold, the per-expert
and batched MoE reconstruct tiers, run through a kernel (`hgemm_f16acc.cu`) that uses the
fp16-accumulator MMA and flushes the partial sums into fp32 every 32 elements of K, so the
accumulation across K stays fp32. `auto` runs a one-time per-device rate probe and enables the
kernel where the fp16-accumulator MMA is at least 1.5x faster; `1` forces it on, `0` forces
cuBLAS. Shapes the kernel does not cover (K not a multiple of 64, N not a multiple of 128,
unsupported strides/alignment) use cuBLAS regardless. Compute capability 12.x uses swizzled
128x128 or 128x64 tiles selected by shape, and a native mixed-precision add when folding
each 32-term FP16 partial into FP32.

### `EXL3_MOE_COOP_KSPLIT` (default: unset)

Split-k factor of the fused decode MoE kernels: `n` runs every column chunk as `n` blocks over
disjoint k ranges whose partial sums the last-arriving block adds. Measured as neutral to harmful
on every GPU here, so the default is no split. Testing knob only.

### `EXL3_MOE_COOP_WIDE` (default: unset)

Tile geometry of the fused decode MoE kernels (the bsz <= 8 path of `BlockSparseMLP`): `0` forces
the narrow tile (32 columns per block, k split 16 ways), `1` the wide one (128 columns per block,
4 x 4 warps). Unset picks per stage: wide on Ampere/Ada at every shape, on Blackwell only for
k >= 4096 or k >= 2048 with 32 or more (token, expert) slots. Testing knob only.

### `EXL3_MOE_FUSED_DET` (default: `1`), `EXL3_MOE_RECON_DET` (default: follows `EXL3_MOE_FUSED_DET`)

Bit-reproducible MoE prefill. By default the fused MoE kernel adds each expert's weighted
output into the token row with float atomics, in whatever order the expert groups finish, and
the batched reconstruct tier accumulates its padded slab with one atomic `index_add_`;
together these are the only sources of run-to-run nondeterminism on the GPU prefill path
(Qwen3.8-Flash-Next KL ~2e-2 between identical 4k-token runs, lfm2.5 ~1e-3, Qwen3-30B-A3B
~3e-4). With `EXL3_MOE_FUSED_DET=1` every assignment of the fused and batched tiers gets a
slot in one per-call fp32 scratch (`assignments x hidden`, ~320 MB per layer call on
Qwen3.8 at 4k tokens): the fused kernel stores its weighted outputs there, the batched
tier's down-projection GEMMs write straight into their slots, and one `exl3_moe_gather` per
layer sums each token's slots in k order with the routing weights. Identical runs are then
bit-identical (verified on all three models), and since the GEMM outputs are written once
and read once either way it costs nothing measurable: Qwen3.8 6198/6219 vs 6164/6178 tok/s,
lfm2.5 25.9k vs 26.2k, Qwen3-30B-A3B 7304 vs ~7100 (atomic). The remaining atomic user is
the streamed CPU-offload tier's fused-kernel call. `EXL3_MOE_RECON_DET` only matters where
the batched tier cannot write into the slot scratch (the streamed tier, or the switch off):
`1` accumulates one expert at a time, `0` with one atomic `index_add_`. The GDN/KDA
recurrent decode kernels (Qwen3.5, Qwen3.8, GLM-5.3) reduce their per-slice partial dot
products in a fixed order unconditionally (no switch, no cost), so greedy decode on those
models is reproducible as well.

### `EXL3_MOE_PINNED_ARENA` (default: `0`, experimental)

Back the CPU worker's expert-weight arena with shared chunks that the parent process also maps
and page-locks (`cudaHostRegister`), and lay each expert's gate/up/down trellis tensors out as
one contiguous block. Streamed prefill (`EXL3_MOE_STREAM_T`) then DMAs an expert's block
straight out of the arena on the copy stream instead of having the worker's stager thread
memcpy it into the pinned handoff ring first; the stager is the prefill bottleneck on fully
offloaded models (mistral-small-4 119B, 54 GiB of experts: 4k-token prefill 700 -> 1850 tok/s
on a gen5 x16 link, decode unchanged within noise). Costs: every chunk is registered with CUDA
as it appears (~0.2 s per GiB, overlapping the load) and the arena is shared memory counted in
both processes' RSS. On Linux the chunks are `memfd`s passed over the worker pipe (resolved at
runtime through libc or the raw syscall when the interpreter was built without
`os.memfd_create`, as conda builds are); shmem pages
only get transparent huge pages where `/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled`
allows it at allocation time: `within_size` (or `always`) is what works, since the chunks are
preallocated with `fallocate` and then page-locked by the parent, so neither the `advise` hint
nor the later collapse pass can convert them (on the default `never` the CPU kernels run on 4K
pages, which cost a few percent of decode on some hosts). On Windows the chunks are named
pagefile-backed sections (4K pages); each must fit both free physical RAM and commit headroom
when it is created, or the load fails naming the chunk.

### `EXL3_HOST_MEM_RESERVE_MB` (default: `2048`)

Host-memory guard for the large CPU allocations (CPU MoE expert arena chunks, the n-gram table
held in RAM with `--ngram_ram`): before each one, `MemAvailable` (from `/proc/meminfo`, or
psutil where that is unavailable) must cover the allocation plus this reserve, or the load
fails with a message naming the allocation. Linux has no allocation-time failure for anonymous
or shmem memory: an oversized arena only fails once the machine has swapped itself into a
minutes-long stall and the OOM killer picks a victim, and pinned pages cannot be reclaimed at
all. `0` disables the check.

### `EXL3_MOE_ARENA_HUGE` (default: unset)

Linux only. With `EXL3_MOE_PINNED_ARENA=1`: `2m` or `1g` backs the memfd chunks with hugetlbfs
pages (`MFD_HUGETLB`) of that size instead of shmem. Requires reserved huge pages
(`vm.nr_hugepages`, or `hugepages-1048576kB` for `1g`) covering the whole arena; allocation
fails with a clear error otherwise. Rejected on Windows.

### `EXL3_MOE_MTILE` (default: `1`)

Row tiles for the fused MoE prefill kernel. The kernel dequantizes each expert's weights once
per 16-row tile, so an expert holding 100 rows re-runs the whole B pipeline seven times. With
this on, experts with 17-32 rows go through a 32-row-tile instance and experts with more than 32
rows through a 64-row one, each as its own launch over its expert range (up to three launches
per layer, largest tile first; a wide instance finishes an expert's remainder with the largest
smaller tile). The wider tiles are separate kernel instances rather than a runtime switch inside
one kernel: sharing one 128-register budget between the tiers costs the 16-row path 60-70% on
Ada / Ampere. Instantiated for the mul1 codebook as N = 128 tile-shape kernels: 30-47% less
fused-kernel time at 24-128 rows per expert on every GPU generation for Qwen3.8-class shapes,
and ~20% for dims that are multiples of 256 (gemma4, Qwen3-30B), where they replace the N = 256
16-row tiling for experts above 16 rows (the N = 256 instance stays for the small-expert
launch, where it is 10-20% faster). Model level, 4k chunks: Qwen3.8 +10% on the PRO 6000, +3%
on a 4090 + 3090 split; gemma4-26B +1-4%; Qwen3-30B neutral. Other codebooks and the
all-fused fast path (no host-side counts) keep the single launch. Outputs are bit-identical to
the 16-row tiling at equal group geometry (per-launch active counts widen the groups, which
reorders the fp32 k-slice reduction to rounding level). Set to `0` for the single launch.

### `EXL3_MOE_TILE_N` (default: `0` = automatic)

`128` keeps the N = 128 tile shape for the fused kernel's 16-row launches on dims that are
multiples of 256 (which otherwise take the N = 256 instances). Measurement knob; the N = 256
instance is faster for those launches.

### `EXL3_MOE_FUSED_ROWS_WIDE` (default: `256`)

Fused-tier row capacity per expert for layers that use the wide tiles (see `EXL3_MOE_MTILE`);
`EXL3_MOE_FUSED_ROWS` still applies to every other layer. With the wide tiles the fused kernel
beats the batched reconstruct tier up to 256 rows (Qwen3.8 4k chunk on the PRO 6000: 6.87k ->
7.06k tok/s over 128 rows), at 4 x concurrency x rows x (hidden + intermediate) x 2 bytes of
static buffers per device (Qwen3.8 on a 188-SM card: +38 MB over 128 rows).

### `EXL3_MOE_BATCH_RECON` (default: `1`), `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_BATCH_RECON` (default: `1`)

Batched reconstruct tier for prefill (`exllamav3/modules/moe_batch_recon.py`): experts with
more assigned rows than the fused MoE kernel's capacity (up to the `EXL3_MOE_RECON_TILES`
budget below) are dequantized and multiplied in count-sorted groups (one pointer-table reconstruct, one
strided-batched GEMM and one Hadamard launch per projection for the whole group, rows padded
to the largest expert of the group) instead of one expert at a time, cutting the per-expert
launch count that dominates many-expert models at large chunk sizes (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next 512
experts, 8k tokens: +16% prefill). The arithmetic is the same as the per-expert path (fp16
rotated-basis weights, fp16 activations, fp32 down-projection output; models with fp32
intermediates such as Gemma 4 keep fp32 gate/up outputs and the activation kernel writes the
fp16 input of the down projection, as in the per-expert path). `EXL3_MOE_BATCH_RECON`
covers GPU-resident experts, `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_BATCH_RECON` the streamed CPU experts (the
`EXL3_MOE_STREAM_FUSED_T` overflow tier). Set to `0` to restore the per-expert loops.

### `EXL3_MOE_RECON_TILES` (default: `64`), `EXL3_MOE_RECON_BATCH` (default: `16`), `EXL3_MOE_RECON_PAD` (default: `1.1`), `EXL3_MOE_RECON_ROWS` (default: `16384`), `EXL3_MOE_RECON_MB` (default: `256`), `EXL3_MOE_RECON_MAX_ROWS` (default: unset), `EXL3_MOE_RECON_FOLDED` (default: `1`)

Tuning for the batched reconstruct tier. Batching pays while a single expert's GEMM cannot
fill the GPU: an `m x n` GEMM launches about `m/128 * n/128` output tiles, and below roughly
the SM count the strided-batched kernel is much faster (PRO 6000, `k = 2048`: `n = 768` runs
1.45x faster batched at `m = 1024` and 2.9x at `m = 256`, `n = 1792` breaks even at
`m = 1024`), while above it the batched cuBLAS kernels are 10-15% slower than the single-GEMM
ones, and the padded slabs cost traffic that grows with the rows. `EXL3_MOE_RECON_TILES` is
that tile budget: an expert stays on the per-expert path once its narrowest projection
(`min(intermediate, hidden)`) would span more tiles, i.e. above `TILES * 16384 / n_min` rows
(1365 rows for `n = 768`, 512 for `n = 2048`). Measured at 8k tokens on a PRO 6000: lfm2.5
(`n` 1792/2048) loses 15% with everything batched and 4% at a 1024-row cap, parity at 512;
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`n = 768`) is within 2% for any cap. `0` batches
every expert; `EXL3_MOE_RECON_MAX_ROWS` overrides the derived row cap directly. The other
knobs: experts per group; `EXL3_MOE_RECON_PAD`, the padded-to-real row ratio a group may reach
before the planner starts a new one (groups fill largest expert first, so this splits only
groups of uneven experts: on Qwen3.8-Flash-Next at 4096 tokens a limit of 1.5 pads 32% of the
tier's rows, 1.1 pads 8% and is 2% faster overall, beating a batch of 8 at 1.5; lfm2.5 gains
2-5%); the padded-row budget per group; the dequantized-weight scratch budget, which shrinks
the group for large expert shapes. `EXL3_MOE_RECON_FOLDED=1` (default) folds both
Hadamards and the sign vectors into the dequantized weights (the formulation the dense
`Linear` prefill path uses above 1024 rows): fewer launches, about 4% faster prefill on
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, at the cost of rounding the folded weights to fp16, which roughly doubles
the tier's error against an fp32 reference of the same quantized weights (9.6e-4 vs 4.6e-4).
Against the unquantized model that difference is invisible: lfm2.5 4.10bpw over 10 x 2048
tokens scores KL 0.0902 to the HF weights folded and 0.0907 unfolded (top-1 85.2% vs 84.9%,
perplexity 40.50 vs 40.56). Note that the two modes are far apart from each other on
routing-sensitive models (Qwen3.8 KL 2e-2, lfm2.5 6e-3) while equally far from the
baseline, so mode-to-mode distance is not a fidelity measure. `0` selects the activation-side
Hadamards.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_START_TIMEOUT` (default: `60`)

Seconds the parent waits for the CPU worker to signal ready after every offloaded layer has
been handed over. Startup is the shared-memory attach, layer registration and thread spawn,
so the default is only a safety net against a wedged worker; raise it on very slow hosts.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_PIN` (default: `1`)

Pin each worker thread (and the worker's own main thread) to a distinct physical CPU core,
SMT siblings last, instead of leaving placement to the OS scheduler. On an SMT host, unpinned
placement is a real source of run-to-run throughput variance, two workers can land on the same
physical core (contending for its execution resources) on one run and not the next; measured on
a 24-core/48-thread SMT2 box, this swung matrix-decode throughput 61–105 GB/s run to run,
pinned flat at ~105 GB/s (88% of the box's measured 24-thread DRAM read bandwidth). Set to `0`
to disable, e.g. on a shared/multi-tenant host where fixed placement may fight the scheduler's
own balancing across other processes. Falls back to no pinning if the CPU topology can't be
read.

### `EXL3_MOE_HANDOFF_PROF` (default: unset)

Enable GPU/CPU handoff profiling, for debug purposes. 

## Model loading

### `EXL3_EXPANDABLE_SEGMENTS` (default: `1`)

Use expandable segments for all Torch allocations. Opt out with a value of 1 or by explicitly
setting `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`.

### `EXL3_LOAD_ARENA` (default: `1`)

Slab allocation for small weight tensors during (deferred) module loads: tensors up to 16 MB
are carved out of shared 128 MB per-device blocks (first-fit over the open blocks, so partially
filled tails are packed by later small tensors) instead of getting one CUDA caching-allocator
allocation each. MoE models with many small per-expert tensors otherwise shatter the allocator
into tens of thousands of segments with large reserved-but-unallocated overhead. Unloading a
module frees its blocks; at most one boundary block shared with a neighboring module stays
pinned. Set to `0` to fall back to per-tensor allocations.

### `EXL3_NGRAM_STREAM` (default: `1`)

Default for `Config.infer_params.ngram_stream_from_disk`: stream an n-gram embedding table
(PLE models, e.g. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) from disk with per-forward row gathers (run-coalesced
positioned reads into pinned staging — threaded preads on Linux, overlapped `ReadFile` at high
queue depth on Windows) instead of loading the whole table into system RAM. The quantized table
is tens of GB, and streaming costs little on SSD-class storage (decode is latency-tolerant at
~30 rows/token; prefill gathers are batched). Set to `0` to hold the table in RAM — worthwhile
only when the table lives on high-latency storage (e.g. HDD, where per-row seeks make streaming
unusable). Also settable per load via `config.infer_params.ngram_stream_from_disk` or
`--ngram_ram` in `model_init`-based scripts.

### `EXL3_AUTOSPLIT_WORSTCASE` (default: `1`)

The layer-split autosplit loader measures each module's transient VRAM with one forward of a
dummy state and keeps that much headroom per device. Some transients don't show in that
forward: attention/MLA decode statics (QSA/DSA families) and, for block-sparse MoE layers,
everything that depends on how the real workload routes tokens: the deterministic slot scratch
(all assignments slotted, `EXL3_MOE_FUSED_DET`), the batched-reconstruct group temporaries,
and the CPU-offload host's GPU side (per-device weight ring, fused-tier buffers, batched tier
statics, padded fp32 outputs), which the measuring forward skips entirely. With the switch on,
these modules allocate and drop an upper bound of those transients inside the measuring window
(`autosplit_extra_measure`), so the split leaves room for them. `0` restores the plain
measured forward.

### `EXL3_AUTOSPLIT_MARGIN_MB` (default: `256`)

The layer-split loader closes a device when its remaining headroom no longer covers the largest
transient measured on it. Besides the `-gs` budget, the check is made against the device
itself (free VRAM plus the allocator's reserved-but-unallocated pool): a split value at or above
the card's size otherwise plans against the several hundred MiB the CUDA context, the loaded
kernels and other processes hold, and the load passes but the first real forward fails. This
margin is added on top of the measured transient in that physical check, covering what a real
forward keeps live around a module (recurrent test states, gathered embeddings, allocator
slack). `0` disables the margin.

### `EXL3_VISION_PINNED` (default: `0`)

Default for `Config.infer_params.vision_pinned`: store the vision component's linear-layer
weights (fp16 or EXL3 trellis) in pinned host memory instead of VRAM, computing straight from
a zero-copy device alias. Trades vision-tower speed for VRAM. Set before loading the vision
component.

## Multi-GPU

### `EXLLAMA_NO_P2P_COPY` (default: unset)

Controls device-to-device tensor moves (the layer split boundary, draft/MTP heads reading the
target model's states, sparse-attention selections shared between layers). On some platforms
the driver reports peer-to-peer access that the PCIe fabric does not deliver, and a direct copy
silently yields garbage. Unset: the first move between each pair of GPUs probes it (a few
random floats there and back, checked on the host) and, if the probe fails, every later move
between that pair bounces through system memory, with a warning printed once. Set to `1`: always
bounce, no probing. Set to `0`: always copy directly, no probing.

### `EXLLAMA_MASTER_ADDR` (default: `127.0.0.1`), `EXLLAMA_MASTER_PORT` (default: auto)

Rendezvous address and port for the tensor-parallel backend. The port defaults to a free port
picked at startup.

### `EXL3_TP_ROUTING_CHECK` (default: `0`)

Debug for expert-parallel MoE layers. Routing is normally replicated: every rank holds the router
and selects experts for itself on the rank-identical residual stream (the deterministic int8 GEMM
and mix kernels make the streams bit-identical across ranks and architectures), which saves two
broadcasts per MoE layer per token. With this set, the layers fall back to routing on the output
rank and broadcasting the selection, while every other rank also routes locally and compares its
top-k selection and weights with the broadcast one; the mismatch counts (split by row class:
single-row, other decode-sized, prefill) are printed at exit. Any mismatch means the streams or
the router differ between ranks, so this is the acceptance test for changes to replicated paths.

### `EXL3_TP_STREAM_HASH` (default: `0`)

Debug: set to N to print a digest of the residual stream after every module on every rank for
the first N real forward passes (warmup passes excluded), to locate where ranks stop agreeing
bit for bit.

### `EXL3_TP_NO_FWD_BARRIER` (default: `1`)

Skip the pass-start barrier in tensor-parallel forward passes. The native collectives are each
ordered by their own stage counters, so the barrier is not required for correctness; skipping it
saves one spin-kernel launch per rank per pass. Set to `0` to restore the barrier (one aligned
sync point per pass at the cost of a small amount of GPU spin time).

### `EXL3_TP_NO_FP16_WIRE` (default: `0`)

The native backend's CPU-assisted all-reduce moves fp16 payloads over an fp16 wire when the CPU
supports F16C (universal on AVX2-era hardware, probed at runtime): exactly-rounded results for
two ranks, fp16-level rounding beyond, at the same PCIe traffic as the bf16 wire. fp32 payloads
always use the bf16 wire (fp16 lacks the range for residual-stream outliers). Set to `1` to
force the bf16 wire for fp16 payloads too, e.g. for A/B comparison.

### `EXL3_TP_NCCL_FP32` (default: `0`)

NCCL backend only: reduce fp32 payloads in fp32 instead of over a bf16 wire (which is what the
native backend always uses for fp32 sublayer outputs). Exact but roughly twice the reduction
traffic; for A/B testing of the wire rounding.

### `EXL3_TP_TRACE_WIRE` (default: `0`)

Print a line (once per process) when the fp16 all-reduce wire first activates. Activation check
for numerics A/B tests: whether the wire engages depends on the model's residual dtype, so a
comparison is only meaningful if the fp16-wire run actually used it.

### `EXL3_TP_REDUCE_THREADS` (default: number of participating ranks)

Number of threads slicing each large-payload accumulate in the native backend's CPU-reduce
helper (persistent workers, spin-parked between jobs; AVX-512 path only). The default of one
thread per participating rank covers the cases where a single thread's ~31 GB/s wire rate falls
behind: three or more ranks (multiple adds per chunk) and PCIe 5.0 links. Set to `1` to force
the single-threaded accumulate. Decode-size reduces are always single-threaded.

### `EXL3_TP_SPIN_RECV` (default: `0`)

Milliseconds each tensor-parallel child worker hot-polls its command pipe after finishing a
command before falling back to a blocking receive. A blocking receive pays scheduler wake
latency (tens to hundreds of microseconds, worse with deep C-states) at the start of every
forward pass; during decode the next command arrives within a few milliseconds, so a short spin
window (e.g. `4`) catches it with no wake cost, at the price of one busy core per rank for the
window. `0` disables the spin. Mostly useful on hosts where TP profiling shows a large stagger
between the main process and child workers reaching their first kernel launch.

## Debug

### `EXL3_NGRAM_GATHER_PROF` (default: unset)

Windows only: print per-gather statistics from the streamed n-gram table path (unique rows,
coalesced runs, reads completed synchronously vs left pending, span tasks drained by pool
workers vs the calling thread). Activation check for the overlapped-`ReadFile` gather when
validating a streamed-table model on Windows.

### `EXLLAMA_DEBUGLOG_<CATEGORY>` (default: unset)

Enables timestamped debug logging for the given category when the corresponding variable is
present in the environment. Categories are defined at the call sites (see
`exllamav3/util/debug.py`); mostly hooks for development.

## Build (JIT extension)

These only matter when the C++/CUDA extension is compiled at import time rather than installed
prebuilt.

### `CUDAHOSTCXX` (default: unset)

Host compiler passed to nvcc (`-ccbin`), for systems whose default compiler is too new for the
installed CUDA toolkit.

### `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` (default: auto)

Standard PyTorch variable; overrides the compute architectures the extension is built for. When
unset, ExLlamaV3 derives the list from the GPUs present in the system.

## `EXL3_DSA_DEBUG_BOUNDS`

When set to `1`, the JIT DSA attention/indexer kernels compile with device-side bounds
asserts on every block-table page read and gathered pool index, and the DSA module range-
checks block-table contents on the host each forward. A violation traps at the faulting
kernel with the kernel name, source line and bad index instead of corrupting memory or
faulting asynchronously downstream. Debug tool for paged-pool issues; significant JIT
overhead (forces Triton debug mode globally), leave unset in production. AOT/BC graph
kernels are unaffected (compiled with asserts off).

## Quantization

### `EXL3_QT_OPTIMIZED`

Forces the quantizer's dense trellis specializations (`quantize_tiles_optimized.cuh`) on (`1`) or
off (`0`) regardless of the per-architecture dispatch (on for every K on sm_120; per K and codebook
on Ada and Ampere where measured faster; the original kernels elsewhere). For experiments only: the
choice also sizes the quantizer's scratch buffers.
